An element produces blocks of content to display in the status bar.

When the status bar is running, every configured element will be prompted for
updates at the configured interval. Once every element has replied with their
output, it's all encoded and sent to swaybar via stdout.

Elements can produce zero or more blocks at each update.

class BaseElement:
    """
    This base class should be subclassed in a swaystatus module package, i.e.
    the `modules` package in the configuration directory or a python package
    with a `swaystatus:modules` entry point. The subclass should be named
    `Element` and be contained in a file named according to how its
    corresponding block should be named.

    For example, if there is a file named `clock.py` in the modules package, an
    instance of the element class would have `self.name` set to "clock".

    The module file could have the following code:

        from swaystatus.element import BaseElement
        from time import strftime

        class Element(BaseElement):
            def on_update(self, output):
                output.append(self.create_block(strftime("%c")))

    Enable the module by adding it to the configuration:

        order = ["clock"]

        # You could also add a click handler:
        [settings.clock]
        on_click.1 = "foot --hold cal"

    All this would need to be put in the configuration directory:

        $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/swaystatus/
        ├── config.toml      # <= configuration goes here
        └── modules/
            ├── __init__.py  # <= necessary, to tell python this is a package
            └── clock.py     # <= module goes here

    name = None

    def __init__(self, name=None, instance=None, env=None, on_click=None):
        """
        Intialize a new status bar content producer.

        If the status bar is configured for click events, then `name` and,
        optionally, `instance` should be set, as they will uniquely identify
        the block that was clicked.

        In order for click events to be useful, handlers for the relevant
        pointer buttons should be defined.

        Ultimately, there should be a method defined in this class named like
        `on_click_<button>` where `<button>` is the pointer button number.

        These methods can be defined explicitly in the element class. This way
        offers the most flexibility and the least hand-holding. They can also
        be defined at runtime by passing a callable to the initializer in the
        `on_click` keyword argument:

            def my_function(event):
                print(f"Got event: {event!r}")

            Element(on_click={1: my_function})

        The `on_click` argument also accepts handlers as a shell command,
        similar to what `subprocess.run` would accept:

            Element(on_click={1: 'foot top', 2: ['foot', '--hold', 'free']})

        If this form is used, the commands are executed in a shell context,
        with all the superpowers that implies, as well as logging stdout and
        stderr to the root logger. This type of handler can also be defined in
        the configuration file, and will be passed to the element class
        automatically.

        Additionally, if the `env` keyword argument is given, it will be added
        to the environment visible to these handlers. It should be a dictionary
        defining any environment variables that should be set when running
        shell command click handlers.

        Building on the earlier example, configurability can be added to the
        clock module by adding an initialization method to the class:

            def __init__(self, *args, full_text=None, **kwargs):
                super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
                self._full_text = full_text or "%c"

        The update method would need to be changed, as well:

            def on_update(self, output):
                full_text = strftime(self._full_text)
                output.append(self.create_block(full_text))

        This alone will behave exactly as it did before, but it can also be
        configured. For example, you might add this to the module's settings in
        the configuration file:

            [settings.clock]
            ...
            full_text = "The time is now: %r"
        """
